# Python Assignment – Dictionary and List Slicing

## 📌 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### 🔹 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2. Takes a student's name as input from the user.
3. Displays the corresponding marks if the student exists.
4. Displays an appropriate message if the student is not found.

### 🔹 Program Logic
- A dictionary is used to store student names and marks.
- The `input()` function is used to get the student's name.
- The `in` keyword checks whether the name exists in the dictionary.
- If found, marks are printed; otherwise, an error message is shown.


## 📌 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### 🔹 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3. Reverses the extracted elements.
4. Prints the original list, extracted list, and reversed list.

### 🔹 Program Logic
- `range()` is used to generate numbers from 1 to 10.
- List slicing (`[:5]`) extracts the first five elements.
- Reverse slicing (`[::-1]`) reverses the extracted list.
- The results are printed using `print()`.
